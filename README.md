# powsybl-network-viewer

Typescript library to integrate network viewers in a javascript project.
This library contains three viewers: 
- network-area-diagram-viewer, to integrate the SVG representing a graph of voltage levels within a network, the SVG and the corresponding metadata JSON file being generated by [powsybl-diagram](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-diagram)
- single-line-diagram-viewer, to integrate the SVG representing single-line diagrams, the SVG and the corresponding metadata JSON file being generated by  [powsybl-diagram](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-diagram)
- network-map-viewer, to display the substations / voltage levels on a map

The library is built with the Vite bundler.
Node from v18+ is required to build with Vite.

Installation using npm:  
'npm install @powsybl/network-viewer'
